# Steacher

We've all seen our students copy-pasting code into chatGPT to get direct answers. But it's a terrible way to learn with AI.

Here's an idea: **have the AI guide the student by asking questions and providing feedback, never by writing the code for them.** Ã€ la [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method). See also Khan Academy's [Khanmigo](https://docsbot.ai/prompts/education/khanmigo-lite-socratic-tutor).
